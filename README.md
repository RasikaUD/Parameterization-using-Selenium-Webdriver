# Parameterization-using-Selenium-Webdriver
This test project executes data driven testing using DataProvider in Selenium Webdriver
Parameterization in Selenium is done in two ways:
a)Using TestNG XML
b)DataProvider
First Method is useful when you just want to parameterize the test case by single hardcoded values.
But for data driven testing, when the data is more and we want to test each test case with more data combinations we can go ahead with DataProvider Parameterization
